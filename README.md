# NeuralNetworkDLL Project

This is a part of my final project degree, a bot for the game Starcraft 2 

I have created a DLL project and i have programmed a basic neural network, in which you can set the number of layers and the size that you want.
The function of this DLL will be to help me predict the next army unit, structure unit and upgrade to improve the units

Currently only use sigmoid function

Not bias programmed, altough i would like to add further other features

i hope it works for you
